# FAQ

#### So it's possible to create a Bot in Whatsapp Web?

Yes, it is.

#### Am I going to be banned?

Hum, so you already know that Whatsapp does not allow Bots, right?

Well, you're right: Whatsapp will ban you forever if they discovery you are running a Bot on long-term. For a small test: Don't worry, go forward.



**I can't guarantee that you are not getting banned in a long term using this Bot. I really don't think so, but I can't guarantee.**
